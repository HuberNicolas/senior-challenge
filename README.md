# DBF Senior Developer Challenge

The DBF Senior Developer Challenge is a coding challenge for applicants to senior positions at the [Department of Banking and Finance](https://www.bf.uzh.ch), University of Zurich. We think that it is fairer and more realistic to judge the capabilities of applicants with a small task, rather than asking theoretical questions about technical topics.

If you seek more information about us and what we work on at the DBF, check out [DBF Join Us](https://joinus.vercel.app) page!

## Application Process

When you apply for a job at our department, you will:

- Part 1: Build a small React application :robot:
- Part 2: Answer four practically-oriented questions :pencil2:
- Part 3: Reflect on your work and the challenge :think:
- Finally: Send us the results of your challenge for a quick evaluation and feedback :outbox_tray:

Everybody that completes the challenge with a good standard gets invited to a job interview. The challenge allows us to focus more on alignment of interests and your cultural fit rather than asking you a lot of technical questions :bell: However, we will most certainly talk to you about the challenge and your responses.

Remember: It is okay to use Google to complete the challenge, you don't need to know everything by heart, and your solution does not have to be perfect!

## Part 1 - Web Development

For the first part of the challenge, you will need to create a small React application based on a small pre-defined skeleton. You will be using React with the Next.js framework, as well as TailwindCSS for styling.

By solving this challenge, you demonstrate that:

- You can work with git and apply version control in your workflow.
  - You commit your work regularly and in clear increments.
- You know the most important principles of Web Development (e.g., HTML, CSS, and their respective Semantics).
- You can work with React and JavaScript libraries, even if they might be unfamiliar (e.g., using docs).
- You write understandable and extendable code (i.e., high-quality).
  - Your code is readable and well-structured.
  - You write efficient and simple code and apply programming patterns and abstractions where sensible.

Details and user stories can be found in [Task 1](Task1.md). This task should take you about 1 hour to complete.

## Part 2 - Quiz

Select four out of the five questions in [Task 2](Task2.md) and write a short response (a few sentences each). You can edit the file directly, or add your responses to a new file. This task should take you about 30 minutes to complete.

With your responses, you demonstrate that:

- You have relevant practical knowledge about web development and computer science.
- You can understand the structure of a web application and use an IDE to support you.
- You can evaluate and form your own opinion about a technology/framework.

## Part 3 - Reflection

Reflect on your work on this challenge and add your responses below, or save them in a new file. This task should take you about 15 minutes to complete.

- How did you approach this task? Try to formulate a few sentences describing your workflow and thought process.
- How did you handle the interaction with the backend/API? What library did you choose and why?
- How did you like this challenge? Is there anything unclear or anything else that we could/should improve?
